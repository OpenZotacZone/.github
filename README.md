# Welcome to OpenZONE

**OpenZONE** is a community-driven initiative dedicated to unlocking the full potential of the **Zotac Zone** handheld on Linux.

Our primary goal is to reverse-engineer and restore the proprietary functionality of the device—dials, fans, lighting, and inputs—to ensure a seamless experience on SteamOS, Bazzite, ChimeraOS, and other Linux distributions.

## Current Projects

We have several active repositories focused on specific hardware features. Check them out below:

### [Dial Drivers](https://github.com/OpenZotacZone/Zotac-Zone-Dial-Drivers)
> *Bring the radial dials to life.*

This project focuses on reverse-engineering and implementing drivers to make the dials around the thumbsticks usable as input devices in Linux.

### [Fan Control](https://github.com/OpenZotacZone/Zotac-Zone-Fan-Control)
> *Silence the noise or maximize performance.*

Enables full fan curve management through **CoolerControl**, allowing you to manage thermals effectively without relying on Windows-only software.

### [HDR & 144Hz Fix](https://github.com/OpenZotacZone/Zotac-Zone-HDR-144hz)
> *Unlock the display's full potential.*

A collection of fixes and configuration steps to properly enable **High Dynamic Range (HDR)** and the fluid **144Hz refresh rate** on the native display.

## Future Goals & Roadmap

We are actively investigating and working on the following features to reach feature-parity with Windows:

* ** Back Buttons:** Enabling mapping and support for the rear macro buttons.
* ** RGB Control:** Reverse engineering the protocol to control the rear RGB stripe.
* ** Touchpad Improvements:** Better driver support for the front trackpads.
* ** Audio & Video:** Fixing initialization issues for the built-in Microphone and Webcam.
* ** Integrations:**
    * Creation of a **Decky Plugin** for easy on-the-fly adjustments.
    * Full support within **HHD (Handheld Daemon)**.
